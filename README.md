See our devpost [Neuro Focus Monitor](https://devpost.com/software/neuro-stress-monitor)

## 📑 Summary

**Neuro Focus Monitor** 

**Neuro focus Monitor** is a real-time focus detection tool that uses the BioAmp EXG Pill and Arduino to capture brain signals and notify the user when they are focused in an Electron-based application.



## ✨ About
- **Brain wave monitoring** Detects brain waves using BioAmp EXG Pill
- **Filtering for stress** Filters EXG signals into brain wave frequency region (0-50 Hz)
- **Notifications** when filtered signals exit beta frequency range (14-40 Hz).
- **Sound alerts** for real-time focus warnings.

## Development Timeline
### November 14
- **Daksh, and Hasan**
  - Started laying the groundwork for the project
### November 15
- **Hasan**
  - Implemented barebones feature of the youtube selenium script to autoskip videos (Next step is to implement exg pill data for the skipping
- **Daksh**
  - Set up the elctron app by creating the renderer files: index(html/js), preload.js, styles.css. Also updated the package.json file and cleaned up other files
  - Dealt with troubleshooting and refinements, fixed GPU crashes through disabling GPU rendering. Debugged other issues so that the window would open properly. Resolved through developing a gitignore file. 
  - Tested window using mock data, used to test real-time visualization of the app. Refined the chart code for better visuals. 
  - Improved other aspects of the project like helping with the arduino data processing, communicating aspects with teamates, cleaned and set up README.md with better setup instructions, and developed how to prompt notifications.
